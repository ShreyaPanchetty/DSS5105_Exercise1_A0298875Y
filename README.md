<h1>DSS5105-Exercise 1- CheckerBoard Pattern Generation</h1>
<br>
<p>This project generates a synthetic grayscale checkerboard using Python.</p>

<h3>Steps to run the checkerboard Python file on a Macbook:</h3>
<li>1. Install the necessary modules numpy and matplotlib in terminal by running: "pip install numpy" and "pip install matplotlib"</li>
<li>2.Run the script: "python checkerboard.py". </li>

It will generate the grayscale checkerboard.

<h3>Git Workflow Steps</h3>
